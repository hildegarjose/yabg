To boostrap container docker:
 1. Copy and paste `.env.example` to `.env`
 2. Fill the `.env` file
 3. Run following command: `# ./scripts/<%- name %>.sh build`

## Development

Run: `# ./scripts/<%- name %>.sh start` to start the container
`# ./scripts/prepare_theme.sh ${THEME_NAME}` to create new Roots theme, example: `./scripts/prepare_theme.sh <%- name %>`
`# ./scripts/yarn.sh {THEME_NAME} ${ANY_YARN_COMMAND}` to use Yarn's commands on the theme, example: `./yarn.sh nourished start`

Wordpress is runing on `<%- name %>.local` virtual host and phpMyAdmin is runing on port `8081`. All changes maded are located in `wordpress/` folder.

### NOTE

Due Wordpress is runing on an virtual host via Nginx proxy, you must need to add `127.0.0.1 <%- name %>.local` to your `/etc/hosts` file.
